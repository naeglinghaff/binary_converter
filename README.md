## Binary Converter

A simple ruby script that converts integers into binary and vis versa.

### Approach

Create a single class that can abstract the process of converting numbers into binary. The class should have 2 public methods that can covert or reverse binary numbers

For example:

| Input | Method | Output |

| 417 | binary.convert(417) | 110100001 |
| 110100001 | binary.reverse(110100001) | 417|
